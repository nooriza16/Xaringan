# Summary
.pull-left[1. WorldView-3 offers one of the <span style="color:darkblue;">**highest resolution commercial** </span> data products at 30 cm developed by Maxar (US) launched on August 13, 2014 <span style="color:darkblue;">**(still active)**</span>. 

2.  As WV-3 is a high-resolution satellite it can be utilized to :
<ul style="padding-left: 20px;"> 
  <li>Feature extraction</li>
  <li>Defense</li>
  <li>Tracking wildfires progression</li>
  <li>Assisting infrastructure planning</li>
  <li>Disaster</li>
  <li>Geology uses & environmental monitoring</li>
</ul>]

## Application : Humanitarian Assistance for Lebanon Red Cross

This photo is capturing right before and after <span style="color:darkblue;"> **ammonium nitrate explosion in Beirut's Port (Lebanon) **</span> on August 5, 2020. 
The prior explosion is on the left (09/6/2020),  after explosion is on the right (5/8/2020).

After the explosion happened, the overall on the ground insight of damaged area is needed to <span style="color:darkblue;"> **navigate the immediate aid**</span>. Maxar low latency & off-nadir agility satellite enables to provide > 2.500 sq km around Beirut's Port using WorldView-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 <span style="color:darkblue;">**within 24 hours**</span>.

# Application : Tropical Forest's Species Classification 

.pull-left[1. Classification were conducted using <span style="color:darkblue;"> **Visible and Near-Infrared** </span> individually and combined with the <span style="color:darkblue;"> **Shortwave Infrared channel**</span>. Meanwhile the <span style="color:darkblue;">**panchromatic band**</span> enables texture analysis to detect crown structure

2. From this picture we could see that the texture analysis really helps to differentiate 2 species
<ul style="padding-left: 20px;"> 
  <li>Picture shows RGB composition (1.2 m)</li>
  <li>Panchromatic-Band </li>
  <li>Image combining A and B</li>
</ul>]

# Application : Hydrocarbon (HC) Detection
.pull-left[
- <span style="color:darkblue;">**Crude oil and natural gas** </span> are among components composed by hydrocarbons.
- Detecting HC using WorldView-3 is essential due to the **costly and small coverage** </span>  of airborne systems. 
- Meanwhile, the orbital intruments are seldom used due to the <span style="color:darkblue;">**lack of spectral bands** </span> .
- Despite the need for further research in aquatic environment, utilizing Remote Sensing imagery's global coverage is valuable for <span style="color:darkblue;"> **assisting and monitoring** </span>  large areas and diverse locations on Hydrocarbon application.]

# Application : Hydrocarbon (HC) Detection

From this graph we could see the **performance** of different band ratios and RBD index in detecting HCs. 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}

 - WorldView-3 could be work well to detect various HC based on  <span style="color:darkblue;">**varied geoglogy** </span> .
 - The presence of <span style="color:darkblue;">**clay minerals** </span> can affect band that is sensitive to HC type
 - Hydrocarbone detection in  <span style="color:darkblue;">**dolomite soils** </span> is easier compared to clayey soil
 - <span style="color:darkblue;">**Heavier crude oil** </span> (API 29) is harder to detect.

# Additional Notes
1.  <span style="color:darkblue;"> **On Disaster Response :** </span>
 - Humanitarian aid needs **quick and high resolution** imagery. 
 - Satellite imagery is capable to support wide coverage, but often being **limited by its high latency access**. This limitation could be mitigated using off-nadir imaging but need extra corrections due to its angle. 
 - On small areas ** drone** could also become an alternative to provide immediate, real-time, and high resolution to support quick-decision making.

2. <span style="color:darkblue;"> **On Tropical Forest Species Classification:** </span> 
 - Image classification using remote sensing might help to identify the location of endangered species, which often hard to spot due to the dense vegetation and limited accessibility in forests.
